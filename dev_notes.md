* 2021-06-27 : I was tinkering with the watch a few days back and suddenly i wasn't able to upload code anymore. For a while it was complaining about "stability issues" and then suddenly, that. It seems like to fix this, i would need either create or buy an arduino bootloader, and use it to reflash the bootloader section inside the arduino. I decided when starting this project that bootloader stuff was out of scope, but hey, its a nice hardware project for me in the future :D At least this wasn't a total failiure, though. I was able to change the text to my favorite quote, fix the date, fix-break-and-fix-again the laser, and got more familiar with the keyboard.h arduino library.
